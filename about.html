<p>I've always seen myself as broken to some degree; however, it's gotten much better over the years. After digging myself out of a pit of social phobia, depression, and other anxieties I'm now ready to start my first career... for real. It's a very gut-wrenching, cold-sweat-inducing move on my part, but I'm so very excited to start my coding/programming career!</p>
