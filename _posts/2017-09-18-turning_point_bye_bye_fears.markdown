My attempt at wrtiting my learning process during the Tic Tac Toe Game Status lesson was absolutely the messiest thing I've ever written... If it was hard to read because it seemed like I was super confused and lost the whole time, I'm sorry. I really was super confused and lost the whole time. Oh, and terrified. 

Living with an anxiety disorder really hampers just about everything I do- or it would, if I sit back and let it. My learning here at Flatiron was made much more difficult from my fears- of failing, of looking stupid, of finding out I really wasn't intelligent enough. Are you like this? I know some people who *don't* have anxiety disorders still have a lot of fears. Friday, for me, was a day that will forever stand out. It marks the first time that I was able to build a method from scratch all by myself. I didn't have to google or ask an instructor for help. I didn't freeze up, I didn't get that tight heavy weight in my chest... I just did it. Whoo!

I then spent this past weekend enjoying the rush of real success and realizing that I had lost something. In accomplishing something I didn't expect to happen(actually starting to understand the mess that is coding) I inadvertently shucked off the cloak of fear I had been wearing. I feel so light! In one of my cherished showers I continued to dispell my fears: why was I afraid of not getting it? Everyone has been so patient in explaining things and helping me to figure it out. Why was I afraid that people would think I was stupid? Everyone keeps telling me it's like beating your head against a wall. Even those that 'get it' and are established programmers or instructors. Why in the world was I afraid that for some reason or another I would fail? I have the most wonderful support system anyone could ever ask for, and basically I'd have to sit in a corner refusing to work in order to fail at this. 

That's not gonna happen!

I've already worked through and read through a few lessons this morning. Because I don't have that fear clogging up my neurons, I'm able to read through the lesson once and understand it. This hasn't happened before. I feel so free! Free to learn, to progress, to make everyone proud. Free to learn how to do something that I super mega enjoy. Free to not feel weird or guilty for wanting to spend hours working at my lessons- even in my free time. Anxiety is a mean thing- I definitely felt guilty and weird for wanting to spend all my time learning here. Don't ask me why, I couldn't tell you if I wanted to. 

Here's a **tl; dr**: Anxiety is stupid and I hate it. I was able to look at each fear and dissolve it, making it so much easier and more enjoyable to learn. If I can do this, then anyone can do this! <3
