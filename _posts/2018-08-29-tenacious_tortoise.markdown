If I was the meditating type this would be my mantra. I'd use it to squash down the persistant frustration I feel knowing I can't move as quickly as I want along my path to coding. My first priority right now is to be a stay-at-home parent; this means I spend most of my time doing all of the housework and supporting and caring for my daughter and husband in their prospective tasks. School, unfortunately, takes a lower priorty. 

My goals haven't changed, however. Neither has my drive, my persistence, nor my motivation. If anything, my motivation is even stronger to succeed. I am going to do this. Most importantly, I *want* to do this.

It  feels absolutely amazing to be back to programming. This is where I am meant to be! Yes! Coming back after a two month hiatus has its drawbacks, however. A lot of my fellow students have moved on to getting jobs, meanwhile I am still back here learning about ORMs and about to jump into Active Record. I feel more than a bit frustrated that I'm not further, but there's something positive about coming back as well.

I'm still passionate. 

Despite having very little time to even *think* about coding for such a long time, I'm jumping right back into it with the same level of passion- if not *more*. This is amazing to me; it's the first career I've pursued and it just feels right. I definitely didn't expect success on my first try, but I'm definitely thankful!

If you're like me and are feeling like you're walking through water toward your goal, please don't give up! We will get this. It may take us a little longer due to health reasons or general life things but we will get there.
