Last night was a complete roller-coaster ride. The tension had been building all day as I worked through the Intro to Ruby assignments. It culminated last night during one of the worst fits I've ever seen my four-year-old throw. Daddy had to put her to bed because Mommy was doing schoolwork... The fit from this sudden change of routine combined with the gooey mess of McDonald's roiling in her poor tummy added up to one very stinky mess all over the front of me- right after I succeeded in building my Tic Tac Toe board from scratch. Ups and downs, man. 

I had been staring at the lines trying to puzzle it out, my frustration building, when suddenly my brain clicked things into place. Could it really be so easy? Am I really trying to overcomplicate things? My heart fluttered lightly as my fingers flew over the keyboard. When I hit enter after typing 'learn test' my heart seemed to stop and patiently wait. My breath came back as the test lines came up green. All green. Tears welled up as that voice so insistant that I couldn't figure it out without googling an answer finally shut up and went somewhere else. I had done it all on my own. I felt relieved and joyful and like I had just conquered the first mountain. For someone with anxiety like me, it means the world when you fight through and keep trying and then come out on top. 

So as I'm sitting there with the tears coming on strong, my daughter screaming in the background, I realize something is wrong. The hysterics are frightened and genuinely upset. I dart in, expecting the worse. "Are you sick?" my husband asks. I already know the answer and pick her up under her armpits, drawing her near... Bleeeehhhhhh! Throw up all over the front of me and all over the floor. Congratulations, Mommy! Here's some vomit! Yeah!

Last night taught me some very valuable lessons. Just because I am learning new skills and beginning a new career with new responsibilities, it doesn't mean that I am exempt from the old ones. My husband hasn't spent as much time with our girl as I have so he simply doesn't know certain things. Until he learns, it's still my responsibility to be her main parent. Another thing I discovered is that I can, in fact, do this. I can totally learn here at Flatiron and still make time to help my family. I made it through my first lessons and I'll keep doing so, even if it *is* in between making dinner and tying her shoes to play outside. 

Fighting to be accepted into Flatiron, enrolling, and taking this course is the best thing that's ever happened to me. You know, after meeting my husband and having the most perfect girl ever. It's teaching me new things, things that go beyond how to build a Tic Tac Toe board. I am so super thankful to be here!
