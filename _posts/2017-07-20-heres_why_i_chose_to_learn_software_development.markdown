There are many generalized, stereotyped answers to the question "Why did you choose to code?" I could answer "It seems really interesting!" or "Money!" or even "Programming is a booming field compared to many other professions." While all of these are really great selling points they aren't the real reason I chose a career in software development. 

Anxiety has screwed up my life from a very, very early age. I spend about 98% of my life worrying and obsessing and being anywhere from mildly uncomfortable to suicidally depressed. Fun stuff! While there have been lots of ups and downs, there are also a few things that have remained constant. The first is my love of Weird Al Yankovic's music. I've been hooked ever since I first really listened to one of his songs. It was bouyant and fun and shiny and positive; even his darker songs have a whimsical feel. It's helped me through some very bleak times knowing that I could be like him- I could grow to be a warm, positive role model for others with little to no darkness left inside. Awesome, right?!

The next thing is my love of the Harry Potter books. Again, after reading the first book I was hooked. I sank into the world, absorbing and memorizing every aspect as I read. When I was feeling sad or lonely(which was a lot) I would disappear for hours to my room to read or onto the computer to role play. The pain and hurt from all the bullying would fade away and I would be whole again as I explored and learned.

The last thing that has remained constant is my fascination with computers and the internet. I used to have a ball building simple expages; I even had a choose-your-own-adventure game using about thirty or forty of them. My next coding experience was with building Neopets' Petpages. They were horribly simple and ugly but to me... it was like I was doing magic. 

Coding is magic. You can type in words and symbols and *bam* you have something people can look at and read and use and admire. You are literally building something out of nothing. This something is a webpage or site that potentially millions of people will see. Holy mackeral! Are you kidding? Why *wouldn't* I want to be a programmer?!

So while I am wound up tighter than a really tightly wrapped yarn ball, I am also super excited to be here today. This is an astronomically huge step for me. I expect the road will be horribly difficult from here on out, but as always I will push through and do my best. Come do some magic with me!
