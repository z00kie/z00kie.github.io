So the word 'depression' is often carelessly thrown around by people who have never actually been depressed and can't understand what it really means. Meanwhile people like me, *my* people, people suffering from depression or anxiety or some other mental illness, are really struggling to compete while carrying a T-Rex on our back. A hungry T-Rex. That wants our blood. 

I have been so excited since starting my career path here at Flatiron. There have been flutters in my heart and a song around my soul because I've finally found my path. A way forward into the sunlit meadow of dancing daisies and sparkling butterfly-teddy bear-fairies. My mecca. A life where I'm independant and successful and strong. Oh, right now I'm strong, but the other two don't really apply... Yet. Because I'm still struggling with the first leg of the fullstack web developer course despite working at it for months. Unlike some, I've had to take breaks because I couldn't physically complete that day's lesson. On a few occasions these breaks lasted weeks instead of days. I hate. HATE. my T-Rex. 

He devours what little energy I have and sucks up all the happiness through a little pink straw all while breathing a thick fog into my very mind. Constant exhaustion(and muscle and joint pain) from carrying his weight tops this lovely scenario off. It royally sucks. I've learned to focus on only one task per day so that I can keep myself moving; unfortunately this meant for the last three weeks or so I haven't been able to do any schoolwork. I just didn't have the mental capacity. I didn't have the energy. I just could not do it.

There is an upside to this story: I've tried everything on my end(eating healthy, exercising, therapy, etc.) and finally know that it has to be a biological cause. Something in my body is broken! Has to be! When I got the blood test results back, I found out I was right. I have an enzyme deficiency and am now taking medicine to correct this. According to my doctor I should be functioning normally within a few months. Not all people are like me, though. For some there isn't any amount of medicine that works. For others their medicine makes them numb and empty, but that's better than the pain. 

As I delve back into school work, I just want to make a quick shout out to those like me who struggle. We not only have to work hard at being students, but we have to work hard at being stable *while* being students. We have to figure out how to appease our T-Rexes without killing ourselves or going mad. Hang in there, keep working with your doctor. For those of you who've never come into contact with depression(personally or with someone you know) be very thankful, and very aware. We are trying our best. Even when we fail, we win because we struggled and tried. 

Here's to trying again. Shut up, T-Rex.
