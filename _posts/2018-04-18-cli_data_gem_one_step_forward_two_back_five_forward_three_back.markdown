I'll be upfront: I have been really apprehensive about tackling my first portfolio project. Completing my first gem would mean I officially would be a real programmer- that's huge. It's been a few weeks since I first grabbed my bundled gem format and I feel like I've been stuck on this project way too long. Now my motivation is that I just want to get it done. Please! Please let me get this done already.

Building my first gem is definitely a huge learning experience. I think it's at this point that everyone learns if programming is really for them. If building your CLI gem seems more loathesome and angst-building than fun you should probably consider finding another career. I most recently ascribed coding to being like you're putting together a puzzle while simultaneously trying to build a statue out of it. It's difficult in many ways, highly challenging. So challenging that even when you think you're on to something there's a decent chance you aren't and have to rebuild several methods over.

That's where I'm at with my gem. I've built it up the framework and it worked fine. I then attempted to build my scraper and it fell apart. I got the scraper part working but then my CLI class needed reworking to accommodate the changes. Once I thought I had that working, I realized I needed to split my Topic class into two: my scraper and topic classes. Then we get a whole host of other issues. Yay! Right now I'm currently trying to figure out why my LifeRing::Scraper.assign_data method suddenly is pulling in an array of two items instead of scraping things properly. 

But I have hope. 

I am having tons of fun puzzling these things out. I'm slowly figuring out my puzzle and carving out my derpy statue.
