title:  "Complete Failure! Why Don't I Know This Yet?!"

So I really haven't been working on my schoolwork all that much yet due to my daughter still being in her phase-in week. Unfortunately this means that I haven't been studying as often as I need to; as a result it's much harder for me to remember all the terminology and functions. This in turn frustrates me, triggers anxiety attacks, and causes my brain to completely shut down. I stare at the words or blinking cursor and: Just. Can't. Think. All of a sudden everything in my mind moves to some hidden back room and has a party(probably Troll-themed) while I'm sitting there feeling completely impotent.

It sucks.

I've cried on many occasions as I've experenced triumphs and failures... The most recent 'failure' was with the Tic Tac Toe Move lab. What happened was I tried two wrong code lines and my brain started to freeze. I felt the panic welling up and tried unsuccessfully to breathe myself to calmness. I then tried the right code! But, alas, I merely glanced at the test(Rspec) explanations and didn't see that it was a new error to fix... In my crazed state I assumed it was the same error. So I changed the correct code to something else, which failed. Utterly. I went around in circles, going deeper and deeper into despair. I was only saved when Avi Flombaum himself saw my desperate plea on Slack. 

For the first time ever I was super thankful that my laptop's microphone and camera failed. He would totally have heard me crying with the fear of looking stupid combined with the relief that someone was helping me. He was so patient and helpful! I guess until now part of me assumed I was supposed to figure it out on my own... you know, despite all the different ways to reach out and ask for help. Yeah. 

Yesterday I learned two things: it's okay to ask for help and it's okay to not know something. The former is something I've had to teach myself over the years and still am not great at. The latter is a huge anxiety trigger for me. Due to some of the abuse I faced, having people perceive me as being unintelligent, slow to get something, and just thinking differently are things I try to avoid at all costs. I hate it when someone calls someone else stupid or slow. I hate that some people don't get that everyone learns in different ways and at their own pace- but that's a rant for another day.

As a result of realizing it's okay not to know what I'm doing yet, I set up an appointment to chat with a Mr. Ian Candy. I also plan on attending some of the study groups offered as soon as I can. I know that I can't do this alone, and now I'm going to accept that I'll just have to face and push through my fears if I want to succeed. It's what I've always done in the past and will(hopefully) always be what I do in the future.

But seriously! Why can't I just *get* it already!

> If you're new to programming, you're probably used to things working. So when they are broken, it's scary. In programming, you have to feel the exact opposite way. It is totally normal for everything to be broken. As you code, you fix things, one by one, and then, when it all works, you're done for the day. -Rspec Fizzbuzz Lesson
